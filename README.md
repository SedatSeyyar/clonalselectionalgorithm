# Hello Everyone
This project finds the variables that make a function maximum by using clonal selection algorithm.
## What is clonal selection algorithm?
The clonal selection algorithm is used to find values that make a function maximum or minimum. The algorithm generally consists of 8 steps.
- Step 1: Random values are generated within the ranges of the variables.
- Step 2: The function corresponding to these values is calculated.
- Step 3: The function values are sorted from small to large or from large to small.
- Step 4: The best results are selected.
- Step 5: Cloning is performed.
- Step 6: Mutation operations take place.
- Step 7: Calculation and sorting is done again.
- Step 8: Select the best results and go to step 2.

However, some steps can be combined.
